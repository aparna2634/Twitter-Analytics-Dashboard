#  Twitter Analytics Dashboard â€“ Internship Project

This repository contains all dashboard files and filtering logic developed as part of my internship. The project focuses on visualizing and analyzing Twitter engagement data using strict conditions, multiple filters, calculated fields, and time-based visibility controls.

##  Project Overview
The Twitter Analytics Dashboard project aims to explore and analyze tweet performance using structured criteria. It covers:

- Engagement rates and top-performing tweets  
- Media engagement vs. media views correlation  
- Comparison of tweets with and without app opens  
- Filters based on likes, replies, impressions, character count, and word count  
- Time-based and date-based visibility constraints  
- Exclusion of specific text patterns in tweets  

All visuals were developed with advanced filtering logic and embedded in a dashboard for interactive exploration.
